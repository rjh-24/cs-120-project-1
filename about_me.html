    <p>
      I visited Korea and Japan with my mom and brother in 2019. We were able to
      see how Korea has changed in the years since my mom last visited as well
      as see family relatives; I was also able to practice some of my Korean
      again yet see how much more I would need to improve to hold a conversation
      on my own. In Japan, we visited my aunt on my dad's side as well as see my
      cousin, his wife, and his three-year-old son. Overall it was a pleasant
      trip despite the potential monsoon in the region at the time.
