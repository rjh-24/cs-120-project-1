    <p>
      I visited Korea and Japan with my mom and brother in 2019. We were able to
      see how Korea has changed in the years since my mom last visited as well
      as see family relatives; I was also able to practice some of my Korean
      again yet see how much more I would need to improve to hold a conversation
      on my own. In Japan, we visited my aunt on my dad's side as well as see my
      cousin, his wife, and his three-year-old son. Overall it was a pleasant
      trip despite the potential monsoon in the region at the time.

      One of my favorite restaurants in my hometown of Houston, Texas is
      <a
        href="https://koreagardenhouston.com/"
        target="_blank"
      >
        Korea Garden </a
      >. The portions are good and the food remains authentic to the Korean
      palate, even according to my grandmother. In addition, the service is good
      and the staff seem genuinely interested in delivering a quality experience
      for families dining out.

      One of my favorite food dishes is a Korean dish called 회덮밥 or romanized
      as hwe-dup-bap. This dish is a raw fish dish with rice and vegetables,
      with strong similarities to the Japanese chirashi-don; however this Korean
      dish uses gochujang, an essential mother sauce made from fermented red
      chillies. Given that one of the key ingredients is raw fish which is
      served cold as well as there is no need for heat preparation, this is
      associated as a summer dish.
